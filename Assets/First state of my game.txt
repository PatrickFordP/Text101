Midgard. Once a thriving city-planet, the world is a shadow of it's former glory.
What used to be towering skyscrapers have become run down slums. The elite have reserved the highest floors to live in decadence without a care in the world.
Not wanting to be confronted with the results of their endless greed, they built bridges and roads between the upper levels and sealed off everything below them.
Now known as the Midgard Underworld, the residents barely scrape by, and most have never seen the sun.

You wake early in the morning to a rumbling, almost like an earthquake.
